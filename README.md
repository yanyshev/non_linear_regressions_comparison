## Non-Linear Regression Comparison.
The script helps calculating some important features of different types of non-linear regression:

  - hyperbolic (explanatory is inverse),
  - exponential (explanatory is logarithm).
 #### It also plots the resuting OLS-equations on the one space with significance levels
